The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if the calculation results in a value that is not a valid CSS value, it can lead to unexpected behavior.  For instance, attempting to calculate a negative value for a property that cannot accept negative values (like `width` or `height`) will likely result in the property being ignored or defaulting to a value of 0. This could lead to elements not rendering properly or appearing unexpectedly. Another issue could be using the `calc()` function with units inconsistently. For example, `width: calc(100px + 50%);` might not work as expected. The browser might not be able to correctly interpret the mixed units.
